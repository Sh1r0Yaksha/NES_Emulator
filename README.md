# NES Emulator

This is a simple attempt to create an emulator for the Nintendo Emulator System (NES) using the dotnet ecosystem, fueled by my passion for computers, love for speedrunning, and a curiosity to learn about the interaction of software and hardware. The code is heavily inspired by the tutorials of One Lone Coder (javidx9) and his [source code](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES/) and hence will be using the same license. 

Besides this, the [nesdev.org](https://www.nesdev.org/) website and [PendleCodeMonkey's 6502 Emulator](https://github.com/PendleCodeMonkey/6502Emulator) has also been very helpful.

This is in no way a working emulator and should not be used to play the games, it is just an attempt to learn how the NES works.

Disclaimer

This is a hobby project created for educational purposes to better understand emulation, computer architecture, and low-level programming. It is not complete yet. However, it is in a playable state and can be used to play a few games without any audio.

It has passed the basic list of the "nestest" tests and some of the illegal opcodes tests

And it runs Super Mario Bros
