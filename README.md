# NES Emulator

This is a simple attempt to create an emulator for the Nintendo Emulator System (NES) using the dotnet ecosystem, fueled by my passion for computers, love for speedrunning, and a curiosity to learn about the interaction of software and hardware. The code is heavily inspired by the tutorials of One Lone Coder (javidx9) and his [source code](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES/) and hence will be using the same license. 

Besides this, the [nesdev.org](https://www.nesdev.org/) website and [PendleCodeMonkey's 6502 Emulator](https://github.com/PendleCodeMonkey/6502Emulator) has also been very helpful.

This is in no way a working emulator and should not be used to play the games, it is just an attempt to learn how the NES works.

# Important

This is just a hobby project that I do in my free time so it is not complete yet.
So far only the ADC and SBC instructions for the CPU have been added and implemented.
